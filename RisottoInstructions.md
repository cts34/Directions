## Risotto
Risotto is a creamy and cheesey Italian rice dish. It is tradtionally made out of Arborio rice and takes a fair amount of time to make. The key to this dish is to constantly move the rice and treat the dish as you would a small child. Watch it carefully! You want it more like soup than like goop! 

## Ingredients

- 4-6 cups of broth (I prefer chicken but any kind of broth works!)
- 1 shallot (Finely chopped)
- 5 tablespoons of butter
- 1 1/2 cups of Arborio rice
- 1/4 cup of dry white wine
- 1 cup of Parmesan cheese

## Directions 
1. Begin by heating 2tbps of butter in a medium saucepan.
2. Once the butter is melted and foamy add the finely chopped shallot and sautee till translucent. 
3. Add the rice into the saucepan and stir for about 3 minutes to toast.
4. Add the dry white wine into the saucepan with the rice and allow to deglaze.
5. After letting the wine sit for 1 minute, add enough of your chosen stock to cover the rice to the pan. 
6. Stir consistently till the rice has absorbed most of the stock.
7. Now again add enough stock to cover the rice 
8. Repeat steps 5-7 until the rice has finished cooking. This can take anywhere from 30-45 minutes but the best way to tell is by just tasting.
9. Once the rice is done cooking add the remaining butter to the rice and stir till the butter has melted.
10. Finally, add the cup of parmesan cheese and stir till that has melted.
11. Optionally, you could add lemon juice and zest, dill, basil, or really any other seasonings you'd like.
